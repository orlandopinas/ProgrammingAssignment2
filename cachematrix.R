## Reverse caching of an matrix
## Matrix inversion is usually a time consuming calculation and there may be some
## benefit to caching the inverse of an matrix rather than repeatly calculating it.
## Formulate a couple of functions that are used to create a special object that
## stores an matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
           inv <- NULL
           set <- function(y){
             x <<- y
             inv <<- NULL
           }
           get <- function() x
           setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
           getInverse <- function() inv
           list(set = set, get = get, setInverse = setInverse, getInverse = getInverse)
}


## This function compute the inverse of the special "matrix" created by
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated(and the matrix has
## not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getInverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
             message("getting cached data")
             return(inv)
  }
  mat <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(mat, ...)
  x$setInverse(inv)
  inv
}
